Document the location of your algorithm implementation and your random trace file handling for the grader to easily find and examine. 

**Note: There is a SIM.java and a Simulation.java. Make sure to look in SIM.java specifically. Ignore "SIM" which is just for the cmd line.
Algorithm: SIM.java >> findConfidenceInterval() >> line 93
File handling: RandomInput.java >> useRandomNum(), beginReadingNumbers(), endReadingNumbers()
You can see where these functions of RandomInput are called in SIM.java >>  SIM(String[] args) >> line 24
